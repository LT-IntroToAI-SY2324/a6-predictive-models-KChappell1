# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
This model makes pretictions as well as highlights the training data being used in the model making checking accuracy simpler

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The r squared coefficient is not close to one which means the data is not likely to be related. 

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
I do not think the model is accurate simply because there is not enough data and the data is not closely related.
