# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?
The r squared value is how correlated the line of best fit is to the other points on the graph. It represents how accurate the prediction data is or will be. 
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
137.46185286
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
I do not think that the model's predicitions are very accurate. The data on the graph has too much variance in it to accurately predict a blood pressure by age. This couled with the low r squared value proves the unreliability of the model. The model could be improved by adding more data points to the original graph. With more information the prediction will be more accurate or it will better demonstrate that there is no correlation between the data points.
